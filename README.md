This repository contains the implementation of various algorithmic trading strategies using Python. The strategies are designed to optimize trading performance through the use of machine learning models and technical indicators like SMA (Simple Moving Average) and EMA (Exponential Moving Average).

Features:
Algorithmic Trading Strategies: Includes multiple strategies using machine learning models to optimize trading decisions.
Data Handling: Utilizes Numpy and Pandas for efficient manipulation of historical stock data.
Data Retrieval: Fetches historical stock data using the Yahoo Finance API (yfinance).
Technical Indicators: Implements common indicators like SMA and EMA for backtesting and strategy evaluation.
Backtesting: Strategies are backtested against buy-and-hold benchmarks to measure performance.
Custom Functions: Contains custom Python functions and classes to manage real-time data retrieval and strategy execution.
